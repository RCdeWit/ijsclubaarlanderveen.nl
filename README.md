# ijsclubaarlanderveen.nl
Static web page for IJsclub Aarlanderveen. Hosted on GitHub pages.

## How to deploy
The `docs` directory contains all of the files which GitHub Actions deploys. To update the website, simply change the files in this directory and push to the `main` branch.

### Why the docs directory?
It's the only subdirectory that GitHub Pages supports out of the box. So including the website there was the least amount of effort.

## Domain and DNS
The domain is registered with TransIP and DNS is administered through the TransIP domain console.
